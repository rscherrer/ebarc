Evolutionary branching with adaptive resource choice

In this individual-based simulation, we explore under what conditions an evolutionary branching point is reached in an asexual species feeding on two resources in two different habitats. Our individuals can feed on only one resource based on some heritable continuous trait and choose the food source that maximizes their fitness.
